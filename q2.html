        <h1> Google Docs .vs. HTML Document </h1>
        <h2> The Key Differences</h2>
        <P>
            Google docs is very much a document type writer. One is able to make spelling mistakes that will easily be
            detected and fixed by google doc checker. Often used for document use such as essays, pamphlets, flyers,
            etc, the document is great at producing charts, paragraph style writing, template creating, and more.
        </P>
        <p>
            Writing in an Html document is extremely precise. The codes must be specific and typed out perfectly for a
            website to be created fully functional and ready to publish. Something as little as forgetting a single
            semicolon will completely change the layout of the types document. Html documents are also out of order but
            also very organized. the document groups all the styles together and keeps it seperate from where one would
            type out actual text that will be viewed on the screen, along with with image coding is placed, links are
            input, etc.
