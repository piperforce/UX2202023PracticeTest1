    <h1>Google Docs .vs. HTML Docs</h1>

    <h3> The Key Differences </h3>
    <x-markdown2html>
        Google docs is a generalized program that can be used by a variety of age groups and skill levels as the program
        automates a lot of features to users can customize their document quick and easy to get their assignment done
        fast. The features allow users to change things such as bold's and italic text by the click of a button but
        selection for things such as fonts is limited to the available fonts.

        HTML documents are more precise but allow for better customization. if a user mistypes of character the entire
        publish document will come out different. using HTML documents allow for more sutomization in terms of fonts and
        everything is controlled by the user and what elements they input.
