        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
            Emphasized and strong text is essentially what is more commonly known ass italic and bold text. You can
            achieve this with "i" and "b" tags, however, these tags are not universal across all browser CSS formats. By
            using "em" and "strong" tags, you can ensure you're final product will display the same across all browser
            CSS formats.
